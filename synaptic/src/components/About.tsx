            <h1>The Genesis Node: Core Code</h1>
            <p>I&aposm a Biomedical Engineering student driven by a central question: How can we use the logic of technology to understand and engineer the complexity of biology? My answer lies at the intersection of machine learning and full-stack development. I don&apost just write code; I build complete, data-driven systems to solve tangible problems.</p>
            <p>My philosophy is built on first-principles thinking. Whether it&aposs architecting a cloud-hosted application or building a reinforcement learning model from the ground up, I thrive on deconstructing a challenge to its core and building a creative, robust solution. For me, full-stack development is the essential tool to bring these solutions to the world, and machine learning is the engine for discovery and insight.</p>
            <p>As a first-year student, this portfolio represents the start of my journey. The projects contained here are the initial constructs of a growing network. I invite you to explore the connected nodes to see my thinking in action.</p>
