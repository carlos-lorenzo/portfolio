            <h1>Cognitive Circuits: The Toolkit</h1>
            <p>A skill isn&apos;t just a tool, it&apos;s a new way of thinking. These are the core languages, frameworks, and methodologies I use to abstract away and solve problems.</p>
            <h2>Full-Stack System Architecture</h2>
            <p>This is how I build the tangible world around an idea. From the user&apos;s first click to the database query that serves it, I construct complete, interactive ecosystems that are both powerful and intuitive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Frontend</b>: Crafting fluid and responsive user experiences with <b>React</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Backend</b>: Engineering robust server-side logic, data models, and APIs with <b>Python</b> and <b>Django</b>/<b>Django REST</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Deployment & Infrastructure</b>: Ensuring solutions are scalable and reliable by containerizing them with <b>Docker</b> and deploying on cloud platforms like <b>Google Cloud</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Machine Learning & Data Science</h2>
            <p>This is the intelligence layer of my work, where data is transformed into insight, prediction, and creation. My primary tools are <b>PyTorch</b> and <b>Pandas</b>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Supervised Learning</b>: I build and train predictive models that forecast outcomes and classify complex data, turning historical information into actionable insights for projects like financial market analysis.</li>
                <li><b>Reinforcement Learning</b>: I have a deep interest in how systems learn through trial and error. To truly understand this I have coded neural networks from the ground up, using <b>C#</b> to train autonomous cars in <b>Unity</b>. This knowledge was then applied to development of agents to tade on the <b>FOREX</b> market, implementing <b>PPO</b> with <b>PyTorch</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Generative Models</b>: I&apos;m currently exploring exploring and learning about the power of generative models in <b>PyTorch</b>, 
                implementing models such as <b>VAE</b>s and <b>GAN</b>s.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Next Frontier: Bio-Inspired Computation</h2>
            <p>This is where my two worlds converge. 
                My work in Biomedical Engineering directly is catalyzed by my passion for computation. 
                I am fascinated by how biological processes can be modeled and exploited to save lives. My goal is to continue exploring this space, bridging the gap between silicon and synapse.</p>
